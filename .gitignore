# UNIGNORE: If you have specific top-level directories you want to track,
# list them here. For example, if your actual source code is in 'my_project_code':
#!my_project_code/
#!my_project_code/**/*  # Also unignore its contents

# UNIGNORE: If you have a 'src' directory you *do* want to track, and
# you want to track 'python' within it:
#!src/
#!src/python/
#!src/python/**/* # And its contents


# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# ADAPTED EXISTING RULES: Now these apply to any directory, not just /src/python
# If a directory (e.g., 'my_project_code/') is unignored above, these rules
# will then apply to paths within 'my_project_code'.
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Ignore Python virtual environments relative to any unignored directory
# The `**/` matches zero or more directories, so it works anywhere.

**/env/
**/bin/
**/lib/
**/lib64/
**/include/
**/.Python
**/pyvenv.cfg
**/credentials.json

# Ignore Python packages (these are generally fine as is, applying anywhere)

# Ignore .pyc files globally (redundant if `*.pyc` is already there, but harmless)
# Keeping it here for fidelity to your original, but `*.pyc` above covers it.
